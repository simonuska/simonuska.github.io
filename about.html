<p>SmartCare was created in 2014 with an initial goal to create a better online information database about the doctors. The creator of the business, Simona Lubytė, decided that something has to change, because it takes too much time to find the needed doctor. The process is so long that some people choose not to even make an appointment.</p>
<p>So, the business aimed to create an online database allowing not only to find the doctors in Klaipėda using customized search tools, but also allowing to book the appointments through a website and an app.</p>
<p> Why SmartCare?</p>
<p> SmartCare provides something that other existing online databases does not. You can look for the doctors using customized search, you can have your whole family hooked on one account, so if you want to register your daughter, you do not need to create a new one. You can also see how other people reviewed the doctor, and because the reviews will be checked for authenticity, no self-promotion or bad-mouthing is possible.</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p> 1. You open a website or an app</p>
<p> 2. Register on the website and put your information (it's all secured and safe)</p>
<p> 3. Use customized search and find the doctor based on specialty, date or last name</p>
<p> 4. Look at doctor's schedule and find the best time</p>
<p> 5. Press one button and register!</p>
